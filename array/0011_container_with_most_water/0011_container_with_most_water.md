11. Container With Most Water


Medium


Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```


## 方法

```go
func maxArea(height []int) int {
    max, start, end := 0, 0, len(height)-1
	for start < end {
		width := end - start
		high := 0
		if height[start] < height[end] {
			high = height[start]
			start++
		} else {
			high = height[end]
			end--
		}

		temp := width * high
		if temp > max {
			max = temp
		}
	}
	return max
}
```


```python
class Solution(object):
    def maxArea(self, height):
        """
        :type height: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        max_area, i, j = 0, 0, len(height) - 1
        while i < j:
            max_area = max(max_area, min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i))
            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        return max_area
```
