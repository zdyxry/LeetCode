25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group


Hard


Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

Example:

```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```

Note:

Only constant extra memory is allowed.  
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */

func reverseKGroup(head *ListNode, k int) *ListNode {
    hair := &ListNode{Next: head}
    pre := hair

    for head != nil {
        tail := pre
        for i := 0; i < k; i++ {
            tail = tail.Next
            if tail == nil {
                return hair.Next
            }
        }
        nex := tail.Next
        head, tail = myReverse(head, tail)
        pre.Next = head
        tail.Next = nex
        pre = tail
        head = tail.Next
    }
    return hair.Next
}

func myReverse(head, tail *ListNode) (*ListNode, *ListNode) {
    prev := tail.Next
    p := head
    for prev != tail {
        nex := p.Next
        p.Next = prev
        prev = p
        p = nex
    }
    return tail, head
}
