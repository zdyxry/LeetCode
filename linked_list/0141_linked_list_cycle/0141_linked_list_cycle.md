141. Linked List Cycle


Easy


Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?


## 方法

使用快慢指针判断。



```go
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * type ListNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Next *ListNode
 * }
 */
func hasCycle(head *ListNode) bool {
    if head != nil {
        fast, slow := head, head
    
        for fast.Next != nil && fast.Next.Next != nil {
            fast = fast.Next.Next
            slow = slow.Next
            if slow == fast {
                return true
            }
        } 
    }
    
    return false
}

```


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        fast, slow = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast, slow = fast.next.next, slow.next
            if fast is slow:
                return True
        return False
```
