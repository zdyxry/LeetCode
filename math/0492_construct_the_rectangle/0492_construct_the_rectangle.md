492. Construct the Rectangle


Easy


For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

```
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
```

You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

Example:

```
Input: 4
Output: [2, 2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
```

Note:  
The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer  
The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.

```go
func constructRectangle(area int) []int {
    mid := int(math.Sqrt(float64(area)))
    for area%mid != 0 {
        mid--
    }
    return []int{area / mid, mid}
}

```


```python
class Solution:
    def constructRectangle(self, area: int) -> List[int]:
        x = int(math.sqrt(area))
        
        while True:
            y = area / x
            if y.is_integer():
                if x > y:
                    return [x, int(y)]
                else:
                    return [int(y), x]
            x -= 1

```
