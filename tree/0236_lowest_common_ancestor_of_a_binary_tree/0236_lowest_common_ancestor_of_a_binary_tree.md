236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Medium

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

 

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

 

Note:

* All of the nodes' values will be unique.
* p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

```go
/**
 * Definition for TreeNode.
 * type TreeNode struct {
 *     Val int
 *     Left *ListNode
 *     Right *ListNode
 * }
 */
func lowestCommonAncestor(root, p, q *TreeNode) *TreeNode {
    if root == nil || root == q || root == p {
		return root
	}
	left := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Left, p, q)
	right := lowestCommonAncestor(root.Right, p, q)
	if left != nil {
		if right != nil {
			return root
		}
		return left
	}
	return right
}
```

        if left and right:
